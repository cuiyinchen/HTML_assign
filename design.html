	<P>
	<STRONG>Repetition:</STRONG>
	</P>
	<P>Repeat visual elements of the design throughout the piece. You can repeat 
	colors, shapes, textures, spatial relationships, line thickness, fonts, sizes, 
	graphic concepts, etc. This develops the organization and strengthens the unity.</P>
	
	<P>
	<STRONG>Alignment:</STRONG>
	</P>
	<P>Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every element should have some 
	visual connection with another element on the page. This create a clean, sophisticated, 
	fresh look.</P>

	<H2>A Brief Explanation</H2>
	<P>
	I used the principle of repetition: The colour of all my text in root.html is black. 
	Additionally, all my topics (Image, Absolute Hypertext Links, Student Information, ...) 
	are in the same font. The bullets of Student Information also displays repetition.
	</P>
	
	<P>
	I also used the principle of alignment: I set some lines between Image, Absolute Hypertext 
	Links, Student Information, Student Grade, and Relative Hypertext Link. This is because 
	those topics are not relevant to each other, those lines are to distinguish. I bolded 
	the font above the image (Cuiyin Chen 102CheC). I applied some colours on the rest of 
	the topics, with 2 of the hypertext links italic.
