	<H2>Text of My Choosing</H2>
	<P>
	I put some student information in root.html, which included my name, 
	program, grades, and some other basic information. Notice that the image I loaded
	was a photo of my younger sister.
	</P>
	<P>
	I enjoy making rubber stamps, watching movies, reading novels, and playing the guitar
	though I am not proficient in music. I love creating things. Next thing I want to created
	is a personal website.
	</P>
	<P>
	I speak Mandarin, English, and Cantonese. I only know a little French. I want to learn 
	Japanese.
