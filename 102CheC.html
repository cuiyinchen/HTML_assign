	<H2>Text of My Choosing</H2>
	<P>
	I put some general information about myself in root.html, which included my name, 
	program, grades, and some other basic information. Notice that the image I loaded
	was a photo of my younger sister.
	</P>
	<P>
	I like making rubber stamps, watching movies, reading novels, and playing the guitar
	though I am not proficient in music. I don't like listening to music (but not always), 
	ECON101, or math/CS questions that are too complicated.
	</P>
	<P>
	I speak Mandarin, English, and Cantonese. I only know a little French. I want to learn 
	Japanese.
